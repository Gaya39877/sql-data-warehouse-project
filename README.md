# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution—from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights **industry best practices** in data engineering and analytics.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleansing, standardization, and normalization are performed to prepare data for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into a **star schema** for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

### This project includes:

- **Data Architecture**: Using the Medallion architecture to design a modern data warehouse.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extract, Transform, Load processes from raw data to final analytical models.
- **Data Modeling**: Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analysis.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Generating SQL-based dashboards and reports for insights.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This project is ideal for:

- SQL Developers  
- Data Architects  
- Data Engineers  
- ETL Pipeline Developers  
- Data Modelers  
- Data Analysts
